LagLocate
=========

The LagLocate source. See the main project page for info. http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/laglocate/

If you use this be sure to set up the external library again.
If you don't know how to do that then read some tutorials :P
If you dont it wont find the bukkit jar and will cause a gazillion errors :D
